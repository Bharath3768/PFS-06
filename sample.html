  	<p>Realme (stylized in all lowercase or as гealme; Chinese: 真我; pinyin: Zhēn wǒ) is a Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer based in Shenzhen, Guangdong. It was founded by Li Bingzhong (known as Sky Li) on May 4, 2018, who was a former vice president of Oppo. Starting originally as a sub-brand of Oppo, Realme eventually ventured as its own brand. Realme then became the fastest-growing 5G smartphone brand in Q3 2021.

In June 2020, the number of Realme's global smartphone users reached 35 million, and AIoT product sales broke a record of 1 million. According to Counterpoint Statistics, Realme ranked 7th in the ranking of the number of smartphones produced globally in the first quarter of 2020, with an annual growth rate of 157%, ranking first in the world.[1]

Currently, Realme has entered 27 markets worldwide, including Asia, Europe, Russia, Australia, and Egypt.[2]</p>

	<p>Nothing was founded in October 2020. It was announced on January 27, 2021, by former OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, 3 months after Pei had left OnePlus. The goal of the new company was to "remove barriers between people and technology to create a seamless digital future." While no product was announced at the time, the company announced that new products from the company would be released later in the year.[6][7]

After Nothing released their first product, the ear (1), Nothing announced a partnership with Qualcomm, which will allow them to use their Snapdragon chips in their future devices.[8]

Speculation on Nothing's first smartphone began to rise in March 2022 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, when the company showed its prototype to executives, including Qualcomm.[9] After securing up to $70 million in Series B Financing, Nothing announced its March 23 keynote,[10][11] at which it would announce its first smartphone.[3]</p>

	<hr width="200px" align="center" size="1px" noshade="">
	<p>iOS (formerly iPhone OS)[7] is a mobile operating system developed by Apple exclusively for its smartphones. It was unveiled in January of 2007 for the first-generation iPhone,[8] launched in June 2007.

It is the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone. It was also used on iPads (introduced: January 2010; availability: April 2010) until iPadOS was introduced in 2019, and on the iPod Touch devices, which were discontinued in mid-2022.[9] It is the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis for three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.[19][20]

The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year.[21][22][23] At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop class applications",[24][25] but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed "iPhone OS".[26] Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone".[27][28] In October 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February".[29][30][31] On March 6, 2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.</p>
